This module is a wrapper for Matplotlib that I wrote to make scientific plots. Much of the benefit is adjusting defaults without making global changes. A major goal was making it easy to automatically reformat the plots to look nice in scientific papers, presentations, or posters. Other features include:
* Accessibility for color vision deficiency
* Nice fonts
* Labeling panes in subplots
* Nice tick intervals
